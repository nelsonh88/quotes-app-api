<h2>Process:</br></h2>
- First made an ERD which can be foud here ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/6Olq7gW.jpg)</br>
- Scaffolded the quotes resource and descriped the relationship between users and quotes.</br>
- Then tested Authentication scripts and quotes scripts and they were successfull!</br>
- For version control I used github and committed everyday a few times a day.</br>

<h2>Unsolved Problems/Future Iterations:</br></h2>
- I want to to add a phone number field for a third party API intergration</br>
- For future additions I want to add a 3rd party API called Twilio where a user will need to input their phone number to get daily quotes from their list.</br>
